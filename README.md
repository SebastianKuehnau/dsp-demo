# dsp-demo

In this repository I want to show how to create your own Design System for your application and how to share it with other developers within your organisation with the Design System Publisher.

In the seb-app directory you find a component library with a [custom-theme](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/tools/dspublisher/custom-theme) in seb-components and a demo application in seb-webapp. The custom theme has been changed and adjusted to show a significant variation of the appearence of the app.

The updated theme and the individual components are listed and documentated in seb-dsp. Therefor the seb-components are imported and the local *docs* theme is extending the seb-theme from the external component module. ***Currently there is an error in DSP why the individual theme is not applied to all components in the design system***
